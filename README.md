# Sehatmand-Duniya

This project focuses on promoting healthy eating habits among Pakistani citizens by
developing a personalized meal-planning platform. The platform aims to generate
customized diet plans that cater to users’ taste preferences and demographic profiles,
such as age and gender, to help them maintain a healthy lifestyle. We used state-
of-the-art data science and machine learning techniques and algorithms to curate a
dataset for Pakistani food recipes and develop a recommendation system to achieve
this goal.
This project intends to provide Pakistani citizens with well-informed food choices
from desi cuisine. The platform’s personalized approach will enable users to make in-
formed decisions about their diet while enjoying the food they love. We believe that
our project will help inculcate healthy eating habits among users and contribute to
the overall health and well-being of the Pakistani population. Through our person-
alized meal-planning platform, we aim to make healthy eating accessible, enjoyable,
and sustainable for all Pakistani citizens.
